# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project is the thrid assignment from Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Program. It is all about creating an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
Based on zipcode that user types in, it will fetch weather data from OpenWeatherAPI and records the data on the end-point of the server.
Then, the bottom section of UI will be updated based with server data

## Instruction
Type in the zipcode that you'd like to get the weather info about and also type in your feeling!
The app will get show the weather info and temperature on the bottom of the page.

## What I learned
By completing this project, I learned how to use async function and promises. By utilizing async function, I was able to change promises to trigger next event based on successfuly execution of the previous functions.  For example, once fetch function to get weather data is correctly processed, then POST route is triggered to input the data into the end point. 

Because it was my first time developing an app utilizing API, it gave me a lot of thoughts about the endless posibilities of web-developemt and applications.
